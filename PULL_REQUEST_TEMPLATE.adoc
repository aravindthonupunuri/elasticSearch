PR review process
- Keep PRs small and manageable (< 1K LOC)
- Review complete within 8 business hours.
- At least 1 reviewer for small PRs.
- At least 2 reviewers for large PRs, one of which must be a lead.
- Reviewers should be assigned in the PR. Team members should self-assign
once reviewers have been decided on. The #list-services Slack channel is a good place
to find people to review the PR.
- You must merge your own PR
