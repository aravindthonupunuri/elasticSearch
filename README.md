Backpack Elasticsearch providing endpoints for
- Search by Co/Registrants name
- Consumer app to Save/Edit/Delete Registry data from elastic search

## Usage
Versions can be found here:
https://git.target.com/Registry-Modernization/backpack-elasticsearch/releases

### General
This api is built using Micronaut framework.

### TAP Secrets and Configuration Automation
The src/main/resources folder contains secrets and other configuration data by TAP deployment environments.
All secrets are kept encrypted under the secrets folder within resources folder.
Each configuration file uses environment extension within its file name e.g. application-dev.yml for TAP dev environment.
Currently following TAP environments are supported

- dev
- stage
- prod

A public/private key pair is used to encrypt/decrypt secret configuration data files. 

##### vela and private key

Prerequisites: 

- Install Vela CLI https://go-vela.github.io/docs/cli/install/
- `git clone git@git.target.com:Lists-Modernization/secrets-key-manager.git`


Vela usage requires private key(s) used by Lists & Registries services to be kept in secrets-key-manager (https://git.target.com/Lists-Modernization/secrets-key-manager), and
posted as secret(s) in vela.

IMPORTANT: Ensure you have following environment variables are defined in your environment:

```
export VELA_ADDR=https://vela-server.prod.target.com
export VELA_TOKEN=<generated-token-from-first-vela-login>
export SECRET_MANAGER_PATH=<path-to-your-local-secrets-key-manager-repo>/secrets-key-manager/bin
```

See https://pages.git.target.com/vela/doc-site/advanced/using-secrets/ for vela secret docs.

##### drone and private key

Drone will be phased out and replaced by vela. During transition as we continue to use drone, we will keep private key in gardenia vault storage (https://pages.git.target.com/drone/doc-site/02-advanced/secrets/#drone-secrets-from-vault). This secret is mounted to drone to automate TAP deployments.

IMPORTANT: Ensure you have following gardenia related variables defined in your environment for gardenia-cli to work:

```
export GARDENIA_SERVER=https://gardenia.target.com
export GARDENIA_TOKEN=<your-gardenia-token>
```


##### public key
The public key is kept under backpack-elasticsearch/data folder as a publicly available key to encrypt data files.


##### scripts

backpack-elasticsearch/backpack-elasticsearch-app/scripts folder contains scripts used to automate deployment of
backpack-elasticsearch-app secrets and configurations to TAP. Similarly backpack-elasticsearch/backpack-elasticsearch-consumer-app/scripts folder contains scripts used to automate the deployment of
backpack-elasticsearch-consumer-app secrets and configurations to TAP.

- generate_encryption_keys.sh to generate public/private key pair
- encrypt_secret_config.sh to encrypt a file contents and save it under resources
- decrypt_secret_config.sh to decrypt contents of an already encrypted file under resources
- deploy_tap_config.sh to deploy environment specific secrets and configuration files (available under resources)
- appinfo.sh keeps application specific data e.g. appname, gitorg, gitrepo etc.
- config_deploy_manager.sh to manage the changes in application's config and secret configurations and deploy them to TAP
- vela_secretkey.sh to store private key in secrets-key-manager as well as vela-secret (pull request required on secrets-key-manager after private key changes)
- gardenia_secretkey.sh to store private key in gardenia vault (will be phased out with drone)

Use image docker.target.com/app/lists/alpine-bash-curl-ssl:1.0.5 in .drone.yml
to deploy secrets and configurations to TAP, as this docker image has bash, openssl and curl needed to run the scripts.

###### Secrets and Configurations deployment steps:

1) Generate public private key pair for the environment (dev/stage/prod)

    ```
    ./generate_encryption_keys.sh dev
    ```
    
    This will generate:
    - /tmp/listsapi_privatekey_dev.pem          - base64 encoded pem formatted multiline private key (under /tmp)
    - /tmp/listsapi_privatekey_dev_base64.txt   - multiline private key is again base64 encoded to make a single line file (under /tmp) that can be stored in secrets-key-manager or gardenia 
    - lists-api/data/listsapi_publickey_dev.pem - base64 encoded pem formatted public key (under data lists-api/folder)

2) Store private key (base64 encoded single line version) to:
 
  - secrets-key-manager and vela-secret
 
     ```
     ./vela_secretkey.sh write dev /tmp/listsapi_privatekey_dev_base64.txt
     ```
     
 - gardenia vault (will be phased out with drone)

    ```
    ./gardenia_secretkey.sh write dev /tmp/listsapi_privatekey_dev_base64.txt
    ```
    
3) Encrypt secrets, if any

    IMPORTANT: The naming convention for configuration and secret files is TapKeyName.ext e.g. if I have secret.yml, then it will be pushed to TAP with key=secret.yml and value="contents of secret.yml file".
    You can omit the extension for cases like env key for TAP i.e. create file env without ext so that it is pushed to TAP as key=env and value="contents of env file" 
    
    All encrypted secrets will be kept under resources/secrets folder. There will be an environment specific file for each environment e.g. secret.yml encrypted versions will be secret-dev.yml, secret-prod.yml etc .
    The TAP deployment script will identify the appropriate secret.yml file for a given environment (e.g. will pick secret-dev.yml for dev environment) and push it to TAP.
    
    Let's say we have following contents for secret.yml in TAP. Create a secret.yml e.g. under /tmp/secret.yml
    ```
    api:
      oauth:
        url: https://oauth.iam.perf.target.com
        client-id: "myclientid"
        client-secret: "xyz"
        nuid-username: "mynuid"
        nuid-password: "mypass"
    ```
    
    IMPORTANT: If you want to have a binary file (e.g. kafka.server.keystore.jks) to be stored as secret in TAP, you will first base64 encode the
    binary file (e.g. cat kafka.server.keystore.jks|openssl base64|tr -d '\n' 2>&1 1>kafka-server-keystore.jks), and use its output file for the next step.
    
    Now run encrypt_secret_config script to encrypt above file
    ```
    ./encrypt_secret_config.sh /tmp/secret.yml dev
    ```
    
    This will put the encrypted file under secrets folder as /resources/secrets/secret-dev.yml
    The developer now opens a pull request to merge /resources/secrets/secret-dev.yml

4) Decrypt encrypted secret to validate and approve
    
    The pull request approver first decrypts /resources/secrets/secret-dev.yml 
    
    ```
    ./decrypt_secret_config.sh path/resources/secrets/secret-dev.yml dev vela|gardenia
    ```
    
    This will output the decrypted contents for approver to see and validate. If everything looks good, approver approves and merges the change.
    
5) Tag the commit to trigger drone deployment of new configurations to TAP
    ```
    git tag -a conf.dev.xx.yy -m "some description"
    git push origin conf.dev.xx.yy
    ```
    
    Tag format: conf.&lt;environment&gt;.majorVersion.minorVersion
    
    .drone.yml trigger stage will use configuration deployment script (config_deploy_manager.sh) to deploy the configurations to specified TAP
    environment. Internally it uses deploy_tap_config.sh script to individually deploy each configuration artifact to TAP.
    
    IMPORTANT: deploy_tap_config.sh uses binary-mode flag to control binary vs text file format to TAP:
    ```
    binary-mode=false to send text files as json formatted value to TAP (a commonly used option for most files)
    binary-mode=true to send binary files (e.g. .jks files) as multipart form data to TAP
 
    ```
####  TAP Datacenter specific configurations

TAP datacenter specific configuration for HA deployments can be performed in following way:

Kafka datacenter specific jks files (keystore and truststore) should include datacenter suffix in their names as follows:-  
```
client-truststore-base64-ttc-stage.jks
lists-bus-keystore-base64-ttc-stage.jks
client-truststore-base64-tte-stage.jks
lists-bus-keystore-base64-tte-stage.jks
```

Datacenter specific values inside secret-stage.yml should use placeholders to refer to values defined in secret-env-\<datacenter>-\<environment>.yml file.

```
secret-env-ttc-stage.yml
secret-env-tte-stage.yml
```

For example secret-stage.yml refers to datacenter specific values via placeholders ${...} as shown below
```
kafka:
  bootstrap:
    servers: ${kafkaenv.servers}
  ssl:
    endpoint.identification.algorithm: ""# disable karka broker cert's hostname verification
    keystore:
      location: /lists-bus-keystore.jks
      password: ${kafkaenv.keystore.password}
    truststore:
      location: /client-truststore.jks
      password: ${kafkaenv.truststore.password}
      type: PKCS12
```

The secret-env-ttc-stage.yml file contains base64 encoded value of properties referred above
```
a2Fma2FlbnY6CiAgc2VydmVyczoga2Fma2EtdHRjLWFwcC5kZXYudGFyZ2V0LmNvbTo5MDkzCiAga2V5c3RvcmU6CiAgICBwYXNzd29yZDoga2V5c3RvcmVwYXNzMQogIHRydXN0c3RvcmU6CiAgICBwYXNzd29yZDogdHJ1ZXN0c3RvcmVwYXNzMQo=
```

The base64 decoded contents of secret-env-ttc-stage.yml file:

```
kafkaenv:
  servers: kafka-ttc-app.dev.target.com:9093
  keystore:
    password: keystorepass1
  truststore:
    password: trueststorepass1
```

A similar approach can be used for non-secret datacenter specific values for application.yml, by using application-env-\<datacenter>-\<environment>.yml file.
